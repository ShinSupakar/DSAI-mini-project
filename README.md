# Introduction to DSAI Course Group Project: Laptop Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes laptop specifications to identify the key factors that influence laptop pricing and to build machine learning models that can predict a reasonable price based on hardware and performance features. The work was completed as part of an Introduction to Data Science and AI course group project.

## 📂 Dataset

Dataset: Laptop Specs – Tech Specifications and Performance Data

Source: Kaggle

Description: Includes features such as processor details, RAM, storage, graphics, display characteristics, and other hardware-related attributes relevant to laptop pricing.

## 📊 Methodology

The project followed a standard data science workflow:

### 1. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values and inconsistent entries

- Removed irrelevant or redundant features

- Prepared data for analysis and modeling

### 2. Basic Statistical Analysis

- Computed summary statistics

- Analyzed distributions of numerical features

- Identified trends and outliers

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized relationships between features and price

- Examined correlations among laptop specifications

- Identified important price-influencing factors

### 4. Machine Learning Models

- Support Vector Regression (SVR) for non-linear prediction

- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to capture complex feature interactions

- Compared model performance to evaluate accuracy
